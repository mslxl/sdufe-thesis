According to the statistical data, under the current retirement policy, due to the aging of the social population structure, the rate of system maintenance in Shandong Province is increasing year by year. It is necessary to adjust the social old-age insurance system by delaying the retirement age and extending the payment period, so as to maintain the actuarial balance. The results show that delayed retirement has a positive effect on the replacement rate of pension; at the same time, with the extension of the life expectancy of the population, the increase of the actual number of months will lead to the decrease of the replacement rate of pension.
